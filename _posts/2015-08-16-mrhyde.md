title:  "New Jekyll Command Tool - mrh/mrhyde - Static Site Quick Starter Script Wizard"
---

Let's welcome the [`mrhyde-tools`](https://github.com/mrhydescripts/mrhyde) gem that includes 
a command line tool, that is, `mrhyde`
that lets you run static site quick starter wizard scripts. For example, use:

~~~
$ mrhyde new starter   # or
$ mrh n starter
~~~

to download and install (unzip/unpack) a theme archive and configure a static site ready-to-use. 
For more quick starter wizard scripts see the [Mr. Hyde's Scripts](https://github.com/mrhydescripts/scripts) library. 
For more themes see the [Dr. Jekyll's Themes](http://drjekyllthemes.github.io) directory. Cheers.
