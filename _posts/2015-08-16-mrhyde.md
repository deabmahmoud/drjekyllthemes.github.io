title:  "mrh/mrhyde - Static Site Quick Starter Script Wizard - Automate, Automate, Automate - New Jekyll Command Line Tool"
---

Let's welcome the [`mrhyde-tools`](https://github.com/mrhydescripts/mrhyde) gem that includes 
a command line tool, that is, `mrhyde`
that lets you run static site quick starter wizard scripts. For example, use:

~~~
$ mrhyde new starter   # or
$ mrh n starter
~~~

to download and install (unzip/unpack) a theme archive and configure a static site ready-to-use e.g.:

~~~
Welcome, before setting up your site Mr. Hyde will ask you some questions. 

Q: What's your site's title? [Your Site Title]:  Another Beautiful Static Site 
Q: What's your name? [Henry Jekyll]: Edward Hyde 
Q: Select your theme: 
     1 - Starter 
     2 - Bootstrap 
     3 - Minimal 
   Your choice (1-3)? [1]: 2 
 
 Thanks! Ready-to-go. Stand back. 
 
  Downloading Dr. Jekyll's Bootstrap Theme... 
  Setting up Dr. Jeykll's Bootstrap Theme.. 
  ... 
  Updating settings in _config.yml... 
    title: "Another Beautiful Static Site" 
    author.name: "Edward Hyde" 
  ... 
 Done. 
~~~

Why not write your own Mr. Hyde wizard script? It's just Ruby (with an added 
mini language) e.g.: 

~~~
say "Welcome, before setting up your site Mr. Hyde will ask you some questions." 

title = ask "What's your site's title", "Your Site Title" 

name  = ask "What's your name", "Henry Jekyll" 

theme = select "Select your theme", ["Starter", "Bootstrap", "Minimal"] 

say "Thanks! Ready-to-go. Stand back." 

install_theme theme 

config do |c| 
  c.title        = title 
  c.author.name  = name 
end 

say "Done." 
~~~

For more quick starter wizard scripts see the [Mr. Hyde's Scripts](https://github.com/mrhydescripts/scripts) library. 
For more themes see the [Dr. Jekyll's Themes](http://drjekyllthemes.github.io) directory. Cheers.
