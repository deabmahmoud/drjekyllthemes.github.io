Still a little early - if you happen to be in Central Europe - 
Gerald Bauer is starting up Europe's first Static Site (Jekyll) User Group in Vienna, Austria. 
The group name is Vienna.html in honor of the static nature of a Jekyll site.

Missing out? No worries - why not start you own YourCity.hmtl group. 
If you're interested in all things "Static is the new Dynamic"
follow along on Twitter [@viennahtml](https://twitter.com/viennahtml). Join us. No database required. Cheers.
